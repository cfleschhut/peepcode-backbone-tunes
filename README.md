Description
===========

Demo application for the PeepCode screencast on Backbone.js.

USAGE
=====

A Node.js server + a Ruby server are included.

The Node version is probably the easiest to run if you already have Node.js installed. Run this command in the Terminal:

    npm start

It will install dependencies and start the server on:

    http://localhost:9292

Otherwise, try the Ruby version:

    rake server
